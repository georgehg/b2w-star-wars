[[overview-http-status-codes]]

Star Wars RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 CREATED`
| The request completed successfully and a new resource was created

| `301 Moved Permanently`
| This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `401 Unauthorized`
| Access to the requested resource was unauthorized, i.e. the user was not authenticated

| `403 Forbidden`
| Access to the requested resource was forbidden, i.e. the user did not have the required role(s)

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `405 Method Not Allowed`
| The request method is not supported for the requested resource

| `409 Conflict`
| The request could not be processed because of conflict in the request. Another resource already exists with same values

| `412 Precondition Failed (RFC 7232)`
| The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request

| `500 Internal Server Error`
| A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable

| `501 Not Implemented`
| The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request.

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

For example, a request that attempts to query using an invalid GTIN will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:
